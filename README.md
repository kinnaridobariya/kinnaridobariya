## 💫 About Me:
I am a dedicated cybersecurity professional with comprehensive experience in both offensive and defensive security disciplines. My career goal is to specialize as a penetration tester, and I am actively preparing for the Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH) certification to solidify my offensive security capabilities. In previous roles as a Security Analyst, I have gained extensive hands-on experience working with industry-leading tools such as Splunk, firewalls, and IDS/IPS systems, focusing on threat detection, prevention, and mitigation. My dual expertise in offensive and defensive security positions me as a versatile asset in identifying vulnerabilities and securing critical infrastructures.

## Fun Fact 
I love joining CTF competitions because it feels like a real-life video game! I get to flex my hacking skills while solving puzzles, and it’s seriously one of the most exciting ways I learn. Who knew cybersecurity could be so fun?
